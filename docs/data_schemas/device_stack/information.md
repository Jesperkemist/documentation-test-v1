# device_stack

The device_stack subsection is a list of the layers in the device.


Should start with the layer in the bottom of the device (i.e. the layer that is furthest from the sun) 


The layer object can be a deeply nested object.


Depending on the functionality of the functionality of the layer and the material, 
there are different information that may be relevant. Photoabsorbers have, for example, been given somewhat more elaborate data sections than other layer. 


The different type of layers that have been defined are found under the headline "layers" in the menu to the left.
