# Welcome to the "Perovskite Tandem Database Project" Documentation

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to encourage a better description of perovskite tandem devices that aligns with the FAIR data principles, i.e. findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. The resources that have been developed to meet this end are described here.

### Data schemas for describing perovskite tandem devices
A core part of this initiative is a development of data schema and guidelines for how to describe a perovskite device. 

- A detailed description of the data schema is found in the "Data Schemas" section in the menu to the left. 

### Online resources
There is an online interface implemented in NOMAD that can be used to create correctly formatted perovskite data files, which is found at:

https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/oasis/gui/user

There is a database housed by NOMAD for perovskite data files. There is also a graphical exploration tool for filtering, visualizing, and analyzing perovskite tandem data files stored in the NOMAD database. Those resources are found at:

https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/oasis/gui/search/tandem-solar-cells-database

Since previous we have a database for perovskite ions

### Instructions and tutorials
Instructions for how to generate perovskite data files, for how to upload them to the NOMAD database, and for how to utilize the data gathered are detailed in the "How-to guides" section to in the menu to the left.

### Instructions for how to extend the data schemas
The data schemas described here will probably never be able to describe everything relevant to a perovskite device. Whenever you find something that is missing, please feel free to help us update the resources. Instructions for how to do is found in the "instructions for developer" section in the menu to te left
